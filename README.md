## Introduction

NFT Display is a web application that simplifies the process of uploading and viewing NFTs. Users can upload their NFT images, which are then stored on IPFS using Pinata's API. The application also fetches and displays all uploaded NFTs in a gallery format.

## Installation

To get started with the NFT Display application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nft-display.git
   cd nft-display
   ```

2. **Open the project:**
   Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser. You can also use a local web server to serve the HTML file for a more seamless experience.

## Usage

1. **Upload an NFT:**
   - Click the "Upload NFT" button to select and upload an image file from your local machine.
   - The file will be uploaded to IPFS via Pinata, and a confirmation message will be displayed in the `output` section.

2. **View Uploaded NFTs:**
   - The "NFTs Gallery" section below the upload section will display all the NFTs that have been uploaded.

## Features

- **Upload NFTs:** Users can upload image files as NFTs to IPFS using Pinata.
- **View NFTs:** Displays a gallery of the uploaded NFTs.
- **Automatic Refresh:** Automatically fetches and displays the list of uploaded NFTs on page load.

## Configuration

The application uses Pinata's API to upload files to IPFS. You need to replace the placeholder API keys with your own Pinata API keys.

1. **Get your API keys:**
   - Sign up at [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/).
   - Navigate to the API Keys section in your Pinata account.
   - Generate a new API key and secret key.

2. **Replace the keys in the code:**
   Open `index.html` and replace the values of `PINATA_API_KEY` and `PINATA_SECRET_KEY` with your actual keys.

   ```javascript
   const PINATA_API_KEY = 'your-pinata-api-key';
   const PINATA_SECRET_KEY = 'your-pinata-secret-key';
   ```
